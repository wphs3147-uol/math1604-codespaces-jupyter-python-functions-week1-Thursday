In practical terms, it defines how a programmer can request data or services from another application or service, and how that other application or service should respond to those requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a web API might allow developers to send a request—often using the HTTP protocol—to obtain information (such as stock prices, weather forecasts, or user data). The API then returns the requested data in a structured format (usually JSON or XML) that the developer’s application can process and use. This abstraction makes it easier to integrate services without needing to know the internal details of how the other application is implemented.\n",
